This repository contains docker containers which can be used to host programming-environments. By using these containers for compiling your application eliminates the need to install these software development kits in your own machine. This is ideal for testing out preview versions of such tools. 

All containers can be accessed via ssl using the `root` user with password `Welkom@Docker01`.
